Hi, and weclome to my journey as an aspiring full-stack web designer/developer!  

I am a retired veteran stuck at home and unable to work due to my disabilities.  
I worked in cyber security after leaving the military but never fully enjoyed my
work.  I have loved programming since I was a young kid creating games for my Apple IIe, later for my IBM using qBasic, and eventually creating my first website entirely with html.  I taught myself these different languages in the past, and am hoping and old dog can actually learn new tricks, and I can learn the modern programming languages.
I will be starting my journey using the online self-pased bootcamp, Devslopes Web Academy (devslopes.com).

Please join me on my new learning adventure to becoming a knowledgeable and successful full-stack web programmer!
